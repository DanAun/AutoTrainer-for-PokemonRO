# Purpose & Feature
The purpose of this project is to create a simple AutoBattler that can automate the tiring process of leveling up your pokemons in battle. The AutoBattler moves you up and down until you are in a battle, where it selects your pokemons first move until defeating the enemy and then repeats the process until you stop the script by moving your mouse to the top left corner of your screen.

# Install & Run
So far the script is only compiled to work on Windows, but little effort is needed to compile into Linux.
On Windows just download the executable and run the program.
